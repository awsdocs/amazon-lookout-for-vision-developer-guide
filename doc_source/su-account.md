# Step 1: Create an AWS account<a name="su-account"></a>

In this section, you sign up for an AWS account\. If you already have an AWS account, skip this step\.

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all AWS services, including IAM\. You are charged only for the services that you use\. 

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root)\.

Write down your AWS account ID because you'll need it for the next task\.
