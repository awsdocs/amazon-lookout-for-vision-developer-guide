# Deleting a dataset<a name="delete-dataset"></a>

You can delete a dataset from a project by using the console or the `DeleteDataset` operation\. The images referenced by a dataset aren't deleted\. If you delete the test dataset from a project that has a training and a test dataset, the project reverts to a single dataset projectâ€”the remaining dataset is split during training to create a training and test dataset\. If you delete the training dataset, you can't train a model in the project until you create a new training dataset\.

## Deleting a dataset \(console\)<a name="view-datasets-console"></a>

Perform the steps in the following procedure to delete a dataset\. If you delete all of the datasets in a project, the **Create dataset** page is displayed\.

**To delete a dataset \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon Lookout for Vision console at [ https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/lookoutvision/]( https://console.aws.amazon.com/lookoutvision/)\.

1. Choose **Get started**\. 

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Projects**\. 

1. On the **Projects** page, select the project that contains the dataset that you want to delete\.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Dataset**\.

1. Choose **Actions** and then select the dataset that you want to delete\. 

1. In the **Delete** dialog box, enter **delete** to confirm that you want to delete the dataset\.

1. Choose **Delete training dataset** or **Delete test dataset** to delete the dataset\. 

## Deleting a dataset \(SDK\)<a name="delete-dataset-sdk"></a>

Use the `DeleteDataset` operation to delete a dataset\.

**To delete a dataset \(SDK\)**

1. If you haven't already done so, install and configure the AWS CLI and the AWS SDKs\. For more information, see [Step 4: Set up the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs](su-awscli-sdk.md)\.

1. Use the following example code to delete a model\.

------
#### [ CLI ]

   Change the value of the following
   + `project-name` to the name of the project that contains the model that you want to delete\.
   + `dataset-type` to either `train` or `test`, depending on which dataset you want to delete\. If you have a single dataset project, specify `train` to delete the dataset\.

   ```
   aws lookoutvision delete-dataset --project-name project name\
     --dataset-type dataset type \
     --profile lookoutvision-access
   ```
