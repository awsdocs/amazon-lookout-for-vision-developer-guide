# Creating an Amazon Lookout for Vision model<a name="model"></a>

An Amazon Lookout for Vision model is a machine learning model that predicts the presence of anomalies in new images by finding patterns in images used to train the model\. This section shows you how to create and train a model\. After you train your model, you evaluate its performance\. For more information, see [Improving your model](improve.md)\.

Before you create your first model, we recommend that you read [Getting Started with the Amazon Lookout for Vision console](getting-started.md)\. If you are using the AWS SDK, read [Getting started with the AWS SDK](getting-started-sdk.md)\.
